\title{Perform bootstrap power analysis on a list of square distance matrices.}
\usage{
bootPower(dm_list, boot_number = 100, subject_group_vector = c(3, 4, 5),
  alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{dm_list}{a list of square distance matrices, with names}

\item{boot_number}{the number of bootstrap samples to perform on each distance matrix in the list}

\item{subject_group_vector}{number of subjects in each group to sample, as a vector.}

\item{alpha}{the threshold for PERMANOVA type I error}
}
\value{
A data frame relating PERMANOVA power to effect size quantified by the coefficient of determination (R^2) and omega-squared.
}
\description{
Estimates the statistical power of PERMANOVA testing to detect the group-level effect in the given distance matrices, based upon bootstrap sampling.
