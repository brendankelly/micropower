# micropower

The *micropower* package is designed to facilitate power estimation for microbiome studies that will be analyzed with pairwise distances (beta diversity) and PERMANOVA (a non-parametric extension of multivariate analysis of variance to a matrix of pairwise distances).

It includes:
+ tools to perform distance matrix simulation to model within-group pairwise distances according to pre-specified population parameters
+ a method to incorporate effects of different sizes within a simulated distance matrix
+ a bootstrap method for estimating PERMANOVA power from simulated distance matrices

A detailed description of the methods underlying the *micropower* package has been submitted for publication.
